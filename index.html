<p>Life is a journey.  You learn how to roll with the cracks in the road, the obstacles in the way.  But in the thick of it all, you keep moving forward.  This journey of mine, I've learned to deal with the most of adversity.  But this journey is mine.  The pictures represent the beauty of life and all it has to offer.  I'm grateful for the chance to travel it.  I encourage you all to have the courage to travel yours.  Enjoy.</p>
